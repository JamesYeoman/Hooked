# any settings not defined will be overriden by previous texture packs much like the vanilla system

hook.model:(basic|diagonal|skull|slime)

# hook.model = basic|diagonal:
# /hook.png
# /hook_loop.png
hook.hook.textureSize:[dimensions of hook texture]
hook.loop.textureSize:[dimensions of loop texture]
hook.hook.offset:[number of pixels to offset the hook texture]
hook.loop.offset:[number of pixels to offset the loop texture]
hook.loop.center:[number of pixels from the bottom of the loop texture to the center of the loop]

# hook.model = slime:
hook.size:[scale of the hook]

# hook.model = skull:
hook.size:.75



chain.model:(basic|spine)

# chain.model = basic:
# /chain.png
chain.link.textureSize:[dimensions of the link texture]
chain.link.offset:[number of pixels to offset each link from the last]
chain.offset:[number of pixels to offset the entire chain]
chain.flat:[(integer) any negative number for normal 90 degree offset of each link, or if it's positive the chain will be flat and rotated by that much]
chain.flat.double:[(integer) if not -1, duplicate links will be rotated by this much from the main line]
chain.flat.rot.[x]:[(integer) number of degrees to rotate the link, rotation indexes wrap, set one to 'END' to end (this is so another texture pack won't continue your rotations)]

# chain.model = spine:
# /chain.png
# /vertebra.png
chain.overlap:[(integer)number of pixels to overlap each link, used for tiling]
chain.tex.height:[(integer)height in pixels of the link texture, used for overlap]
chain.scale:[scaling factor of spine]
chain.spacing:[(integer)number of pixels between each perpendicular face]
chain.spacing.start:[(integer)number of pixels to offset the beginning of the perpendicular faces]



particle.model:(basic)

# particle.model = basic:
particle.name:[name of particle]
particle.frequency:[frequency of particles]
particle.distance:[maximum distance from line]
